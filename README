# To Do List

This project aims to create the frontend of a task list application (To Do List) that allows users to effectively organize and manage their daily tasks. The application should provide a dynamic interface for querying, adding, modifying, and deleting tasks.

## Features

- Create Task: Users can add new tasks to the list, providing a title and a description.
- Read Tasks: Users can view all existing tasks in a list.
- Mark Task as Completed: Users can mark a task as completed.
- Edit Task: Users can edit the title and description of an existing task.
- Delete Task: Users can delete a task from the list.
- Sort Tasks: Users can sort tasks by creation date, due date, status, etc.

## Additional Features

- Filter Tasks: Users can filter tasks by status (completed / pending).
- Comments on Tasks: Users can add comments to specific tasks.
- Task Categorization: Allow users to assign categories or tags to their tasks for better organization.
- Task Priorities: Users can assign priorities to tasks (high, medium, low) and sort them accordingly.
- User Registration: Users can register in the application by providing a username and password.

## Requeriments

- The design must follow the Mobile First approach.
- Adhere to coding best practices and appropriate naming conventions.
- Implement GitFlow for version control.
- Individual work is required.
- Apply SCRUM methodology:
- Define user stories with their respective requirements and acceptance criteria.
- Use a Kanban board to track task progress.
- Complete the work within a sprint of 8 effective days (demo and delivery on 25/08).

## Evaluation

The demo will last for 10 minutes and will be divided as follows:
- 3 minutes to explain the workflow and status of the product backlog.
- 2 minutes for the demonstration.
- 5 minutes for a code review.

## Deliverables

- README file
- GitHub repository
- GitHub Pages link
- Figma design (if applicable)
- Demo and code review
- Kanban board

## Performance Criteria

- Correct delivery of files in the GIT repository.
- Adherence to general working guidelines up to the date.
- Fulfillment of the final presentation guidelines.
- Compliance with the coding best practices learned.
